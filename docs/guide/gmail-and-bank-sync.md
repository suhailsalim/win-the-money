# Gmail & bank sync

## Gmail auto-import (read-only)

Connect your Gmail with Google's standard sign-in (OAuth + PKCE, `gmail.readonly` scope — the app can
never send, delete, or modify mail). Tokens are kept in the iOS Keychain. Building your own copy of the
app requires a free Google OAuth client ID — see the repo README.

Two scans run, on demand and periodically in the background:

1. **Transaction alerts** — bank/card alert emails (HDFC, Axis, Scapia/Federal RuPay, …) become
   transactions within minutes of a purchase. Daily "available balance" emails become dated balance
   anchors, so your balance tracks even between statements.
2. **Statement attachments** — statement PDFs attached to emails are imported automatically, using
   your vaulted passwords. Locked ones queue under Settings → **Needs password**.

A processed ledger guarantees a re-scan never re-imports something twice.

## Account Aggregator (Setu)

Optional RBI Account Aggregator sync: link accounts through the AA consent flow and pull transactions
directly from the bank rails. Requires your own Setu credentials (see README); off by default.

## How sources reconcile

Alerts are fast but thin; statements are slow but authoritative. The app merges them:

- Same account + amount + sign within a few days → one transaction, statement details win.
- Balance readings only ever move the anchor **forward in time** — a stale email or old statement can
  never clobber a newer reading.
